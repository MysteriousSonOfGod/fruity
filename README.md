# fruity.py
My first pip package, all about fruits!

# CURRENT FUNCTIONS

Currently, the only functions that I have made are the "Get Fruit" Function, [EX: fruityy.getfruit(mango) ], that would pull up a json formatted string about the fruit.
I am using fruityvice for the api, I'm simply making it easier to adapt it to Python, also to increase my skills!

# PLANNED FUNCTIONS:
I'm planning
Random Fruit (Get's a random fruit)

# CODE
Please don't use this code yet, it doesn't work!
I wrote this all in an online compiler and directly into github, I need to adapt it to my pc and then make it a module for easier installation and no bugs!
